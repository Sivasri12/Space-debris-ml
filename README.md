ML project to predict satellite risk from space debris
# 🛰️ AstroWatch: Space Debris Risk Predictor

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict if a satellite is at risk from nearby space debris.

🚀 **Built with 💖 by Sivasri**, a passionate AI & space enthusiast who believes in creating smarter skies for a better future.


## 📌 What It Does
- Takes in data like:
  - Distance to debris (km)
  - Relative velocity
  - Shield strength of satellite
- Predicts **High** or **Low** risk using a trained ML model

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Google Colab (Mobile!)
- GitHub for sharing
- Random Forest Classifier (ML model)

## 💡 Future Plans
- Turn this into a real-time mobile app
- Add live satellite data using APIs
- Collaborate with ISRO or private space startups
- Help students understand orbital threats better
